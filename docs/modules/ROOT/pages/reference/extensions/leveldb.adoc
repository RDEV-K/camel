Using LevelDB as persistent EIP store

== Camel Quarkus limitations

In native mode the extension uses a port of LevelDB written in Java (https://github.com/dain/leveldb#leveldb-in-java[documentation]),
which is within 10% of the performance of the C++ original. Please upvote https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/1911[this issue]
if you do not like the present state.

This extension does not support binary payloads in native mode since object serialization is https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/460[not supported] on GraalVM. To work around this limitation, the extension instead uses Jackson serializaton / deserialization.

The problem will be solved when the camel-leveldb component is refactored to use Jackson and custom
serializers (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-15679[issue])
