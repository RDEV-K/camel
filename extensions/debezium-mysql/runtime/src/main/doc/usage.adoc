We can not add driver as a compile scope dependency for legal reasons.

To use extension, you have to add runtime dependency to mysql driver. Suggested version and driver is
`mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.20`. (It is the transitive dependency from `o.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-mysql:1.5.0.CR1`)

To execute integration tests you have to add driver jar into the specific folder in the module. Name of the file (which
also specifies version) is defined as property `mysql.driver.file` with default value
`libs/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar`
