There are two different configuration approaches:

* Google storage client can be defined via quarkus properties leveraging the Quarkiverse - Google Cloud Services - Storage (see https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-google-cloud-services/blob/main/storage[extension git page]).
Camel will autowire client into the Google-storage component.
This configuration allows definition of only one storage client, therefore it isn't possible to define several different endpoints, which run together.

* When multiple storage clients are needed, one or more storage client bean need to be registered in the registry (e.g. via a CDI bean producer). Each storage client bean could then be referenced from distinct endpoints.
