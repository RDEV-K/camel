In native mode extension uses port of the LevelDB written in Java (https://github.com/dain/leveldb#leveldb-in-java[documentation]),
which is within 10% of the performance of the C++ original. Please upvote https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/1911[this issue]
if you do not like the present state.

This extension does not suport binary payloads in native mode. Object serialization does not work in native mode
(see https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/460[issue]). Extension uses Jackson serializaton/deserialization, which brings
this limitation. Problem will be solved as soon as camel-leveldb component will be refactored to use Jackson and custom
serializers (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-15679[issue])
