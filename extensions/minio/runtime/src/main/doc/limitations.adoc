This extension leverages the Quarkiverse Minio. Standard application.properties mechanism is used to define connection (see http://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-minio#configuration-reference[documentation]).

It is mandatory to configure the Minio client in properties and Camel will autowire client into the Minio component.
Configuration via application.properties allows definition of only one minio client, therefore it isn't possible to define several different minio endpoints, which run together.
