If your persistence objects implement `java.io.Serializable`, you have to add configuration of all serializable classes.
There is a new serialization support in GraalVM 21.0. Developers can configure classes
for serialization via the serialization configuration file
`-H:SerializationConfigurationResources=/path/to-serialization-config.json` option. For more
information see https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/2730[PR with feature].

If your persistence objects implement `org.dizitart.no2.mapper.Mappable`. All classes have to
implement also `java.io.Serializable` and have to be registered for serialization (see previous option),
even though the Java serialization won't be used.
