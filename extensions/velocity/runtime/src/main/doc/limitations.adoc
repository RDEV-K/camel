If property `allowContextMapAll` is set to `true` there is a limitation in native mode. Reflective calls to methods
of several classes in camel are not allowed (for example `org.apache.camel.support.DefaultExchange`). Therefore
some expressions won't work (for example `${exchange.properties.*}).

You can allow reflective calls to such classes (for example by using application.properties), but keep in mind that it brings
some security risks.
